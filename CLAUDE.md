## What this project is

**EchoSoul** (full academic title: *AI-Based Emotion-Driven Music Recommendation System Using Face Analysis*) — a desktop application that captures a user's facial photo via webcam, classifies their emotion using a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B3 CNN, then generates a Spotify-streamable playlist that matches the detected emotion.

> **Naming note:** The product is branded **EchoSoul**. The local MySQL database is named **`echosoul`** (set via `DB_NAME` in `.env`). The old name `emotion_music` was swept from the docs and code. **Exception:** the rule **table** is still named `emotion_music_mapping` (and its seed file `data/seed/emotion_music_mapping.sql`) — that is a schema identifier, deliberately left unchanged.

This is a **BSc (Hons) Computer Science capstone project** at Sunway University. The owner is the sole developer. The project has two phases:

- **Capstone Project 1 (CP1):** Planning, research, design — already completed (Sept 2025 – Jan 2026). The full planning document (the source of truth for design decisions) is referenced throughout these docs.
- **Capstone Project 2 (CP2):** Implementation, testing, evaluation — runs May–July 2026. This is what we are building.

The project follows the **Waterfall methodology** with weekly supervisor check-ins. Phases must be completed and documented in order: Requirements → Design → Implementation → Integration & Testing → Operation & Maintenance.

## Core user flow (one-paragraph summary)

User launches the desktop app → logs into Spotify (one-time OAuth) → on home screen, chooses either *"Take Photo"* (webcam) or *"Choose Mood Manually"* → if photo, system detects exactly one face, preprocesses the ROI, runs it through the EfficientNet-B3 emotion classifier, and maps the result (happy / surprised / sad / angry / neutral) to a valence–energy–tempo target range → system queries the local MySQL music catalogue for songs matching that range, randomises a subset into a playlist, and displays it → user can play the playlist (Spotify Web Playback SDK streams to the embedded webview), save it, edit it, or re-take the photo.

If detection fails (no face, multiple faces, blurry, dark, or detected emotion is outside the supported scope — e.g. *fear* or *disgust*), the system shows an error page and routes the user back to the home screen.

## Tech stack (locked unless noted)

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Language | Python 3.11 | Match TensorFlow 2.x stable support; avoid 3.12+ until confirmed. |
| Deep learning | TensorFlow 2.x + Keras API | `tf.keras.applications.EfficientNetB3` with ImageNet weights. |
| Face detection | OpenCV Haar Cascade (`haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml`) | Capstone plan specifies this. Simple and adequate; if accuracy is poor at integration time, swap to MediaPipe Face Detection — but only with supervisor sign-off. |
| FER dataset | RAF-DB (already downloaded by owner) | 7 basic emotion classes; we collapse to 5 (drop fear & disgust) at the application layer, not at training time — see `docs/FER_MODEL.md`. |
| Database | MySQL 8.x | Stores music catalogue, emotion–music mapping rules, user playlists. |
| Music catalogue source | 3 pre-built Kaggle datasets, merged (see `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md`) | Spotify `/audio-features` was deprecated for new apps on **27 Nov 2024**, so we cannot fetch features at runtime. We use static dumps. |
| Music streaming | Spotify Web Playback SDK (JavaScript, in the embedded webview) | **Requires Spotify Premium** for every user. Disclosed in capstone report. |
| Spotify Web API (auxiliary) | Spotipy 2.x | Used only for OAuth flow + artist-genre enrichment script. The deprecated `/audio-features` endpoint is **NOT** used. |
| Desktop wrapper | PyWebView 5.x | Embeds HTML/CSS/JS frontend inside a native window; bridges Python ↔ JavaScript. |
| Frontend | HTML + CSS + vanilla JavaScript | No React/Vue. Keep dependencies minimal for a solo capstone. Spotify Playback SDK is plain JS, so vanilla integrates cleanly. |
| Version control | Git + GitHub (private repo) | |
| IDE | VS Code | |

**Do not introduce new frameworks or libraries without explicit owner approval.** If a task seems to call for one (e.g. "use Flask"), pause and confirm first. The dependency surface is intentionally small.

## Critical context — read this before writing any code

### 1. The supported emotion scope is 5, not 7

RAF-DB labels 7 basic emotions: **happy, surprised, sad, angry, neutral, fear, disgust**. The system supports only the first 5 for music recommendation because the user survey (see CP1 planning doc §3.2) showed users rarely listen to music intentionally when feeling fear or disgust.

**Decision: train the model on all 7 classes, then filter at the application layer.** Reasoning:
- More training data per class → better feature learning.
- The "out-of-scope detected" error page (already designed in the planning doc) is the user-facing handler for *fear* and *disgust* predictions.
- Future scope expansion stays low-cost.

Do **not** drop fear/disgust at the dataset level. See `docs/FER_MODEL.md`.

### 2. Spotify `/audio-features` is dead for this project

On **27 November 2024**, Spotify deprecated the `/audio-features`, `/audio-analysis`, `/recommendations`, `/related-artists`, and featured/category playlist endpoints for any new third-party app. New apps registered after that date receive HTTP 403.

Implications:
- We **cannot** call `/audio-features` at runtime to enrich tracks.
- We **must** use pre-built dumps for valence/energy/tempo (see `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md`).
- Spotify Web Playback SDK is **not** affected — playback still works.
- ⚠️ **Update (June 2026):** `/artists` genre data is **also gone** for this app — the batch `/artists?ids=...` endpoint returns 403, and the single-artist object no longer includes a `genres` field at all (verified empirically). Genre enrichment therefore uses **Last.fm** (`artist.getTopTags`, keyed by artist name), not Spotify. See `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md` Stage 3. Needs `LASTFM_API_KEY` in `.env`.
- Do not write code that calls the deprecated endpoints, even in fallback paths.

### 3. Music data is local; playback is remote

The 1.2M-track merged catalogue lives in MySQL on the user's machine. Recommendation logic runs entirely against the local DB. Spotify is contacted **only** to play a track — we pass the `track_id` to the Web Playback SDK, which streams audio from Spotify's servers to the embedded webview.

This means:
- The recommender works offline (after initial DB seed).
- Playback requires internet + Spotify Premium login.
- Every track in our DB must have a valid Spotify `track_id` so playback works.

### 4. Every user needs Spotify Premium

The Web Playback SDK does not stream to Free accounts. This is a hard Spotify policy, not a workaround we can fix. The capstone report discloses this; the app's first-run screen should make it explicit before the user attempts OAuth.

### 5. Privacy-sensitive data — webcam images

Captured facial images:
- Are processed in-memory only.
- Are **never** written to disk except in explicit debug mode (off by default).
- Are **never** transmitted to any external service.
- Are discarded immediately after emotion prediction.

This is a hard requirement. Do not add features (analytics, "save photo," cloud backup, telemetry) that would violate it.

## Working conventions for Claude Code

### Documentation-first

Before writing code for a module:
1. Read the relevant doc in `docs/` (e.g. `docs/FER_MODEL.md` before touching `src/fer/`).
2. If the doc is silent on a design point, ask the owner — do not invent a convention.
3. If the doc is wrong or out of date, fix the doc first, then the code.

### Small, reviewable changes

The owner is a single developer reviewing every diff. Prefer:
- One concern per commit.
- Working code at every commit (no half-implementations).
- Clear commit messages: `module: short imperative summary` (e.g. `fer: add Haar cascade face detection`).

### No silent dependency additions

If a task seems to require a new pip package, stop and confirm with the owner first. Adding `requests` is fine; adding `fastapi` or `pytorch` is not.

### Style

- Python: PEP 8, formatted with `black`, type hints on public functions, docstrings on non-trivial functions. Line length 100.
- JavaScript: 2-space indent, ES2020+, no transpilation step (PyWebView's embedded webview is Chromium-based, modern JS is fine).
- SQL: uppercase keywords, snake_case identifiers, one statement per line in migrations.

See `docs/CODING_STANDARDS.md` for the full conventions.

### Tests

- Every module in `src/` gets a matching `tests/` file.
- Unit tests use `pytest`.
- The FER model has a fixed test image (a known-happy face) checked into `tests/fixtures/` to verify the inference pipeline end-to-end.
- The recommendation algorithm has a fixed seed for randomised playlist selection so tests are deterministic.

See `docs/TESTING.md`.

### Long-running scripts are background-safe

The artist-genre enrichment script (`scripts/enrich_artist_genres.py`) must:
- Checkpoint progress to disk every 1,000 API batches.
- Resume from the last checkpoint if interrupted.
- Handle Spotify 429 responses by honouring the `Retry-After` header.

Do not write enrichment code that has to complete in one shot. See `docs/MUSIC_DATA.md`.

## Status (update this section as the project progresses)

- **Phase:** CP2 — Phase 3 (Implementation & Unit Testing), as of July 2026.
- **Completed so far:**
  - **Frontend scaffold (Track F, partial):** pages, CSS, and JS for home / photo / mood / loading / result / error (not yet wired to a Python bridge).
  - **Track C — FER (DONE):** trained EfficientNet-B3 model dropped in (`models/fer_model.keras`, 86.68% 7-class / 87.62% 5-in-scope). Grayscale architecture (`src/fer/model.py`) + training script (`scripts/train_fer_model.py`); runtime image pipeline (`src/fer/image_pipeline.py` — MediaPipe Tasks `FaceLandmarker` eye-alignment + square crop, same landmark topology as `scripts/align_facial_images`, exactly-one-face gate, blur/dark/bright quality checks); inference + out-of-scope wrapper (`src/fer/inference.py`); tests in `tests/fer/`. The as-built training setup diverged from the original plan (grayscale `[0,255]` input, categorical focal loss, MixUp, block4+ unfreeze) — `docs/FER_MODEL.md` and `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md` were rewritten to match. Local inference runs on `tensorflow==2.21.0` + `mediapipe==0.10.35` (installed; `requirements.txt` regenerated). Face detection uses the Tasks `FaceLandmarker` API (needs `models/face_landmarker.task`) because mediapipe 0.10.35 removed the legacy `solutions` API. All 22 `tests/fer` pass, including an end-to-end happy-face photo → "happy" prediction.
  - **Track A — Database (DONE):** migration runner (`src/db/migrate.py`), connection pool (`src/db/connection.py`), schema migrations (`music`, `emotion_music_mapping`, `playlist`, `playlist_song`, `v_in_scope_music`), 5-row rule seed, indexes, passing tests (`tests/db/`). Migrations applied to the local `echosoul` database.
  - **Track B — Music data pipeline (DONE):** the five-stage pipeline (`scripts/download_datasets.py` → `normalise_datasets.py` → `enrich_artist_genres.py` (Last.fm) → `merge_catalogues.py` → `seed_database.py`) is written and has been **run end-to-end**. The merged catalogue is loaded into the local `echosoul` DB: **1,310,164 rows** in `music`, all three indexes present, 5-row rule table populated.
  - **Track D — Recommendation (DONE):** rule lookup + candidate query + random sample (`src/music/recommender.py`) and playlist save/load/delete (`src/music/playlists.py`), with deterministic-seed integration tests against the real catalogue (`tests/music/`). Validated now that Track B data is loaded.
  - **Track E — Spotify integration (DONE):** keyring token cache with file fallback (`src/spotify/keyring_cache.py`, service `EchoSoul`, `WinVaultKeyring` backend on Windows), PKCE auth flow (`src/spotify/auth.py` — `has_spotify_session`, `start_login_flow`, `get_valid_access_token`, `logout`), Premium check + cached profile (`src/spotify/account.py` — `verify_premium`, `get_user_profile`). 27 mocked-Spotipy/keyring unit tests pass (`tests/spotify/`). Added the `keyring==25.7.0` dependency (owner-approved) and regenerated `requirements.txt`. `docs/SPOTIFY_INTEGRATION.md` was corrected to the real spotipy 2.26 API (no `as_dict`; `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` env name). Redirect URI is a **fixed-port loopback with a custom path**, `http://127.0.0.1:8888/echosoul-callback` (Spotify's dashboard rejects `localhost` and port-less forms as "not secure"); login uses our own `_CallbackServer` (branded page + CSRF `state`) rather than Spotipy's built-in server. **Manual E2E OAuth run verified (2026-07-08):** real browser login succeeded end-to-end — token cached in the OS keychain, `get_valid_access_token()` returns a valid token, and `verify_premium()` confirmed the owner's account is **Premium** (required for the Web Playback SDK).
  - **Track F — F1: entry point + bridge (DONE):** PyWebView entry point (`src/main.py` — window over `frontend/index.html`, MySQL fail-fast check at startup, FER warm-up on a `webview.start(func=...)` worker thread, `private_mode=False` so the Spotify SDK's localStorage persists across runs, `ECHOSOUL_DEBUG=1` opens devtools; launch with `python -m src.main`) + the full JS bridge (`src/api/bridge.py`, one flat `BridgeApi` bound as `js_api`): Spotify session/account passthroughs, `detect_emotion` (pipeline → inference; maps the model's RAF-DB label **`surprise` → app vocabulary `surprised`**, which the frontend/rule table/recommender use; a module lock serialises MediaPipe/TF access because PyWebView runs each bridge call on its own thread), `quick_face_check` (≤320 px downscale, decode failure ⇒ `face_count: 0`), `generate_playlist`, and playlist CRUD (save/list/load/rename/delete, with JS float→int coercion). 20 mocked unit tests in `tests/api/` (110 total pass). Installed `pywebview==5.4` (locked-stack item; 6.2.1 exists but the stack table locks 5.x) and regenerated `requirements.txt`.
  - **Track F — F2: auth gate + login/premium pages (DONE):** `frontend/js/bridge.js` (`callPy` / `callPyWithTimeout` — waits for `pywebviewready`, 30 s default timeout, per-call override); `frontend/index.html` rewritten as the real auth gate + `js/auth_gate.js` (session → Premium → home, `location.replace` so the gate stays out of back-history; on session-restore failure it does **not** logout — a transient network error must not destroy a good refresh token — it routes to login with a one-shot `sessionStorage.login_notice`); `pages/login.html` + `js/login.js` (login call uses a **190 s** bridge timeout so Python's 180 s OAuth wait times out first); `pages/premium_required.html` + `js/premium_required.js` (upgrade link via new **`open_external_url`** bridge method — allowlisted to `https://www.spotify.com/` so the webview never navigates away; re-check via gate re-run; switch-account via logout). Both new pages are chrome-less (pre-auth) Vibe Canvas glass cards. `tests/api` now 25 tests.
  - **Track F — custom title bar & branding polish (DONE):** window is now **frameless** with an in-page title bar (`frontend/js/titlebar.js`, loaded on all 9 pages): min/max/close buttons injected into the chrome pages' top app bar (spare header space = `pywebview-drag-region` drag handle; dbl-click = maximize) and a slim overlay strip on the pre-auth pages. New `window_minimize` / `window_toggle_maximize` / `window_close` / `window_is_maximized` bridge methods (maximized state read from the native `FormWindowState`, verified `str()` == "Maximized" on the real backend). `src/main.py`: title-bar/taskbar icon via WinForms `Form.Icon` (**must** wait for `events.shown` + marshal via `Form.Invoke` — worker-thread assignment fails silently), explicit `AppUserModelID` (else the taskbar shows the Python icon), DWM rounded corners on Win11, `frameless=True, easy_drag=False`. Branding: `frontend/assets/img/app.ico` + `logo-96.png` generated from `logo.png`; OAuth callback page restyled to Vibe Canvas colours with the logo inlined as a data URI (the one-shot callback server can't serve assets); login/premium pages use owner-supplied Spotify glyphs (`spotify-black.png` on the green button, `spotify-green.png` on the premium badge, both with `onerror` hide). Frameless windows get no native resize borders from the WinForms backend, so `titlebar.js` also injects invisible edge/corner handles driving `window_begin_resize(edge)` (captures the anchor rect **once**, returns the size baseline) + streamed `window_resize(w, h)` steps (absolute `SetWindowPos` from that anchor). ⚠️ pywebview's own `resize(fix_point=...)` must NOT be used for drags — it re-reads cached form bounds per call and the race compounds until the window walks off-screen (hit this live). Clamped to `MIN_WINDOW_WIDTH/HEIGHT` (shared constants in `src/api/bridge.py`, reused by `main.py`'s `min_size`); CSS-px→native-px scale factor calibrated at drag start (owner's display runs ~120% scaling — verified live). `tests/api` now 34 tests.
  - **Track F — Free-account soft gate (DONE, owner-built):** the Premium gate became a **soft** gate — `premium_required.html` offers "Continue without playback"; Free mode stashes the profile in `sessionStorage.spotify_profile` the same way the auth gate does for Premium. Downstream, `chrome.js` hides the bottom player and `result.js` drops play-all + opens each track in Spotify via `open_external_url` (allowlist extended to `https://open.spotify.com/`).
  - **Track F — F3: home + live sidebar (DONE):** new `frontend/js/sidebar.js` (module, loaded on all six chrome pages) fills the `#sidebar-playlists` shell chrome.js now renders: rows from `list_user_playlists` (emotion emoji, name, song count), click → `result.html#playlist=<id>`, kebab menu with inline rename (`rename_playlist`) and two-step delete (`delete_playlist` — PyWebView has no reliable `confirm()`; deleting the playlist open on the result page routes home). Shared helpers extracted to `frontend/js/playlists_ui.js` (`EMOTION_THEMES`, `trackRow`, `dbTrack`, duration/meta formatting, Free-mode open-in-Spotify) — `result.js` and `home.js` refactored onto it. `result.js` gained the **saved-playlist view** (`#playlist=<id>` → `load_playlist`; no mood banner; "Playlist not found" fallback; reloads on `hashchange` so switching playlists from the result page re-renders). Home's static "Crying TT" section replaced by a live **"Your latest playlist"** showcase (newest saved, first 5 tracks + view-all row; hidden while nothing is saved). Header: notifications button removed (owner request); **profile chip** shows the Spotify display-name initial and opens an account dropdown (name / email / Premium-Free badge + Log out — direct `pywebview.api.logout()` since chrome.js is a plain script, then `login.html`).
  - **Track F — F4: photo page webcam (DONE):** new `frontend/js/camera.js` (module; replaced the placeholder `photo.js`). Live `getUserMedia` preview (1280×720 ideal, CSS-mirrored selfie view — captured data is NOT mirrored), 2 Hz `quick_face_check` pings (≤320 px JPEG payload; chained `setTimeout` with an in-flight guard so pings never pile up behind the FER lock; 5 s per-ping timeout, failures lock the shutter and keep retrying) driving the oval guide (green = exactly one face = shutter enabled; red = none/several) + a status line. Shutter grabs the **full-res lossless PNG** (per `docs/IMAGE_PIPELINE.md`), freezes it, offers Retake / "Use this photo"; Use stores `sessionStorage.captured_image_b64` + `emotion_source="camera"` → `loading.html` (the `detect_emotion` call there is F6). Stream stopped on `pagehide`; camera-unavailable shows a reason + "Try camera again". `photo.html` gained the frozen-frame `<img>`, status line, captured-state buttons and retry block.
  - **Track F — F5: mood page (DONE):** the manual path was already wired (mood cards / home quick chips → `sessionStorage.last_emotion` + `emotion_source="manual"` → `loading.html`); F5 finished it with sessionStorage hygiene — a manual pick now drops any `captured_image_b64` left by an abandoned photo run (a full-res PNG is multi-MB that would otherwise live for the whole session) — and a picked-once guard so a fast second click can't swap the emotion after navigation to loading is already queued (`mood.js`, `home.js`). `docs/FRONTEND.md`'s mood snippet corrected to as-built (`.mood-card`, plain `loading.html` — no `?next=result`; `loading.js` branches on `emotion_source` alone).
  - **Track F — F6: loading/result/error on the real backend (DONE):** `loading.js` rewritten as the flow's engine (module): camera path reads `captured_image_b64` (**removed immediately — consumed either way**) → `detect_emotion`; pipeline errors / out-of-scope set `error_code` (+ `detected_emotion`) → `error.html`; manual path skips inference; both → `generate_playlist(emotion)` (backend default 25) → `current_playlist` + `playlist_emotion` → `result.html`. All exits via `location.replace` (transient page, inputs consumed — Back must never re-run it; history reads photo → result), ~1.5 s minimum display so the animation doesn't flash, no-flow entry bounces home, empty playlist ⇒ `playlist_failed`, rejected bridge promise ⇒ `unexpected`. New `frontend/js/error_handler.js` (plain script on `error.html`): FRONTEND.md's message table + `playlist_failed`/fallback; keys read not consumed (refresh keeps the message); no code ⇒ static prototype copy stays (design preview). `result.js` detection view now renders the real stashed tracks (per-emotion copy kept as `metaLead` + real `formatPlaylistMeta` counts; no state ⇒ `location.replace` home) and wires the **save button** (`#save-playlist-btn`): `save_playlist` named `Happy — Jul 12, 9:41 PM`, on success bookmark fills with the emotion accent + stays disabled + DIY toast (no reliable `alert()` in PyWebView) + `refreshSidebarPlaylists()` imported from `sidebar.js` (same module instance — ES module cache) shows the row live; saved view removes the save button. Edit button = `data-placeholder` (edit mode deferred). Loading's progress bar (`#loading-progress`) is **staged-real**: width + CSS transition glides toward a per-stage cap while the bridge call runs (55% detect, 90% playlist — no real per-call percentage exists), finishing fill to 100% timed to land just before navigation; error exits freeze it in place. Not yet run against the real app — first full camera→playlist E2E happens with the F9 manual checklist.
  - **Track F — F7: Web Playback SDK (DONE):** new `frontend/js/playback.js` (module on the five bottom-player chrome pages — home/mood/loading/result/error; no-ops for Free accounts and when the footer is absent). SDK script injected **dynamically** (onerror ⇒ "Playback unavailable" idle state, offline-safe); `Spotify.Player` device **"EchoSoul"**, token via `get_spotify_access_token`. File navigation kills the SDK per page, so **cross-page continuity is server-side**: `pagehide` stashes `sessionStorage.playback_resume` (`"playing"|"paused"`) + `player.disconnect()`; the next page's `ready` transfers the session to its new `device_id` (resumes mid-track after a sub-second gap). **No unconditional transfer on ready** (would hijack the user's phone/desktop session — deliberate deviation from the CP1 sketch, doc updated); only a page that reached `ready` may clear the stash (the short-lived loading page must leave it for result to consume). Un-gestured resume needs `src/main.py`'s `_set_webview2_browser_args()` — ⚠️ `WEBVIEW2_ADDITIONAL_BROWSER_ARGUMENTS` **overrides** pywebview's programmatic args (verified live; losing `--allow-file-access-from-files` kills every ES module on `file://` — the function restates pywebview 5.x's flags + ours); `autoplay_failed` still handled (toast "press play"). Bottom player: `chrome.js` now renders it idle with IDs (transport disabled) and `playback.js` drives it — title/artists/album art, waveform bars = live progress **and seek bar** (1 s `getCurrentState` poll while playing — local extrapolation lied on stalled sessions), hover volume slider + mute (volume persists via `sessionStorage.playback_volume`); queue button stays placeholder. **Transport = Web API commands** (resume/next/previous/seek/shuffle with `device_id`), NOT the SDK's local methods — after a paused transfer the device has metadata but no loaded media and `togglePlay`/`nextTrack`/`seek` silently no-op (verified live); pause stays local (`player.pause()`), with an optimistic icon/state flip so pause-then-navigate stashes the right resume state. Errors funnel to `onSdkError`: auth ⇒ gate redirect **once per session** (loop guard), playback ⇒ toast (deliberately no auto-skip), init/account ⇒ unavailable state. `playTracks(trackIds, startIndex)` exported for `result.js`: waits for `ready` (12 s), `activateElement()`, PUT `/me/player/play` with `uris`+`offset` (one 700 ms retry on 404 — a fresh device may not be registered server-side yet). `result.js` wires play-all (button + cover overlay) and per-track row clicks (queue starts at that track) in **both** views; `showToast` moved to and `trackRow(…, onPlay)` extended in `playlists_ui.js`. **Verified live (2026-07-14, F8 session):** real audio in the webview (Widevine works in WebView2, fresh profile), play-all, honest player UI, pause/resume, cross-page resume (~sub-second gap; track may restart near its beginning if Spotify's last-synced position was early).
  - **Track F — F8: styling pass (DONE, via live screenshot audit):** drove the real app over CDP (`webview.settings["REMOTE_DEBUGGING_PORT"]` + Node WebSocket driver + `Page.captureScreenshot`, isolated `storage_path` webview profile so it coexists with a running dev instance — WebView2 hard-fails 0x8007139F if two processes share a user-data folder with different args) and audited every page at 1280×800 and the ~760 px floor. The Vibe Canvas import held up almost everywhere; fixes: **photo page vertical overflow** (Capture button was below the fold — the "1280×800" window is only ~1024×640 CSS px under the owner's 125 % display scaling; viewfinder now `max-h-[44vh]` + trimmed `pt-20/pb-6`, ratio yields to the cap and object-cover crops), mood card label `SURPRISE` → `SURPRISED` (app vocabulary). The audit also caught and fixed the four live F7 bugs folded into the F7 notes above (env-var override, pause/navigate race, lying clock, paused-transfer no-op transport). Screenshot harness (launcher + `cdp.mjs`) lives in the session scratchpad — see memory `echosoul-cdp-screenshot-harness` for the recipe. Note: `DESIGN.md` is referenced by docs/FRONTEND.md + tailwind-config.js but does not exist in the repo (owner may hold it outside git).
- **Current focus:** F9 — the manual UI test checklist (docs/TESTING.md): full camera→emotion→playlist→playback E2E in the real window (webcam permission, FER on a live face), Free-mode degradation, login/logout round-trips. Playback itself is already live-verified.
- **Next milestone:** Track F complete (all pages on the real backend, playback working inside the webview); then Phase 4 integration testing.

## Out of scope (do not build these)

The capstone plan explicitly excludes these features. If a task asks for them, push back and confirm with the owner:

- Mobile app (Android/iOS).
- Wearable / physiological sensor emotion detection.
- Lyrics-based emotion analysis.
- Long-term personalisation (user listening-history-based ranking).
- Full music licensing / payment flows.
- Multi-user accounts inside the desktop app (each install is single-user).
- Cloud backup of playlists.
- Real-time continuous emotion tracking (one snapshot per request only).
